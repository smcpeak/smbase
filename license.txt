All of the modules in the smbase directory are
hereby placed in the public domain.

Except:
  - on-leaving-scope.h has its own copyright and Apache license.
  - crc.cpp was not written by me.  I lost track of where I originally
    got it, although the same code can readily be found in various
    places, with various open source licenses prepended, by searching
    for phrases in its comments, so at least I'm not the only one being
    sloppy about attribution for this file.
