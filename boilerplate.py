# boilerplate.py
"""
Definitions to enhance error reporting in a Python program.

To use, first import all the symbols:

  from boilerplate import *

Then define `main` somewhere:

  main() -> None:
    ...

Finally, at the end, call it via `call_main`:

  if __name__ == "__main__":
    call_main(main)

Principally, this suppresses the stack trace on exceptions unless the
DEBUG envvar is set to a non-zero value.  Instead, it prints a single
line that includes the exception class name (since unfortunately some
exceptions rely on that to communicate the problem) and any text string
that accompanies it, falling back to the file:line where it was raised
if there is no text.

It also offers a few convenience functions for error reporting, such as
the `die` function.

Finally, it changes Ctrl+C so it terminates the script, similar to most
other programs, rather than raising an exception (which is often
ineffective at stopping the program).
