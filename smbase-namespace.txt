smbase-namespace.txt
====================


Most of smbase is *not* inside the `smbase` namespace, but I'm trying to
gradually change that, at first just by putting new code into it.  The
eventual goal is for all of smbase to be in that namespace.

If I add `namespace smbase` to an exising header, I also put `using`
declarations at the end that export the names to the global namespace
for client code compatibility, guarded by a check for the
SMBASE_NO_COMPAT_ALIASES preprocessor symbol being defined.  This at
least marks where they are and would allow a client to turn them off.
