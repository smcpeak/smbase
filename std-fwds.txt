Explanation of the std-*-fwd.h headers


Overview
========

The std-*-fwd.h headers, plus detect-libcpp.h, provide forward
declarations for standard headers for improved compile times.

These headers are based on the work of Philip Trettner:

  https://github.com/Philip-Trettner/cpp-std-fwd


Usage
=====

Where a forward declaration will suffice, instead of:

  #include <string>
  std::string something();

write:

  #include "smbase/std-string-fwd.h"
  stdfwd::string something();

Then in the implementation file:

  #include <string>
  std::string something() {...}

The `stdfwd::`-prefixed name is an alias for the `std::`-prefixed name,
so these will be compatible.


The `stdfwd` namespace
======================

It is unfortunate that a different namespace than `std` is used, but
there is no alternative for things like `std::vector` since the default
allocator argument can only be provided once.

In practice, types that do not take default arguments normally left
unspecified (e.g., allocators and comparators), such as `stdfwd::string`
and `stdfwd::optional`, can be written normally as `std::string` and
`std::optional`.  Using `stdfwd` in such cases can be seen as proactive
in case the library changes to add an argument or for the sake of
consistency.


Implementation notes
====================

The basic idea is to detect which libc++ is in use, then provide
declarations that are compatible with it.  Obviously, this is not
portable, strictly conforming C++ because user code is not allowed to
declare things in `std`.  But it's fine in practice.

If the libc++ cannot be detected then std-XXX-fwd.h falls back to
including <XXX>, so it should be no worse than using the standard header
directly.  By default a warning is issued, but that can be suppressed by
defining `SMBASE_SUPPRESS_UNKNOWN_LIBCPP_WARNING` on the command line.

Changes
=======

Relative to Philip's work:

* These headers have a fallback mechanism if libc++ is not detected
  (explained above).

* These headers are subdivided by standard header, rather than all
  rolled into one, to make the fallback no worse than using a standard
  header directly in the fallback case, and for closer alignment with
  normal usage of standard headers.
